# Solve optimization problem with metaheuristic

## Discrete optimization : TSP problem

There are two tsp problem to solve: Djibouti and qatar. The data is from to the [math.uwarterloo.ca](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html)

* Djibouti
- 38 cities 
- Optimal tour is 6656
- Genetic algorithm was choosen as optimization algorithm. After multiples tests of parameters, the bests one closer to the optimal tour are :
   - population : 1000
   - offspring : 1000
   - mutation : 0.05
   - crossover : 0.9
- Results 
   - fitness : 9648
   - computation time : 48.70 seconds
